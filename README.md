# Project1

Target Audience: People who want to see places but are too lazy to go

Problem that product will address: Brings down the unneccessary borders of humanity

Primary Goal of Product: Allow user to access webcams from around the globe while giving easy access to travel booking information for the current area in view

Identify and prioritize user stories:

1:) As a user, I want to search for an area by city name or area code and view a corresponding webcam.
//HTML
    ** Frame out HTML using Bootstrap to set up space for webcam to be appended
    ** Set up space for travel information to be appended
    ** Set up search bars to catch user input 
    ** Dedicate space to append search results
//Javascript
    ** Write function to take user input from searchbar and append webcam results to HTML/ Clear previous results
     **Allow user to search for area by name or area code

2:) As a user, I want to keep my previously viewed locations saved for later viewing.
    **Allow user to build list of favorite locations and save them to Firebase
    **Function to append saved locations to HTML based on user's previous saves
    **Function to add current webcam to list
  

3:) As a user, I want to view travel booking information for the current area being viewed.
    **Utilize API to pull travel information based on user input into searchbar
    **Append information to HTML for user viewing
    **Allow user to search for area by name or zip code

Bare minimum funcionality:
-User Login to personal account/ Log back out
-User ability to search a location by name or zip code
-On location search, also display travel booking information for area
	-Flight information
	-Hotels (by rating)
	-Air BnB
	-Tourist Attractions
-User ability to set searched locations to "Favorites" and pull them back up on login
-Link to outside material guiding users to utilize a VPN for more cost effective travel

Hopeful functionality:
-Spotlight section that shows popular/highly viewed webcams
-Sidebar to list webcams by region
